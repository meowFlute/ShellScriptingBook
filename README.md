# ShellScriptingBook
## Shell Scripting by Steve Parker

### Scott's Note
#### `Book_Download` Folder
I just checked this book out from my local library. I didn't write any of the scripts in the Book_Download folder. I got them from the book download page, [Link to download page](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Shell+Scripting%3A+Expert+Recipes+for+Linux%2C+Bash%2C+and+more-p-9781118166321)

#### `scripts` Folder
This folder is going to be my scratch space to take notes on things I'm reading, write my own scripts, etc.

I'll try to keep a naming convention of sorts that is `ch[number]_[topic]_[extra_info]`
